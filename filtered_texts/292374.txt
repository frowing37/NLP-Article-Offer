A Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioner for Nonsymmetric Linear Systems.
--A
This paper is concerned with a new approach to preconditioning for large, sparse linear systems. A procedure for computing an incomplete factorization of the inverse of a nonsymmetric matrix is developed, and the resulting factorized sparse approximate inverse is used as an explicit preconditioner for conjugate gradient--type methods. Some theoretical properties of the preconditioner are discussed, and numerical experiments on test matrices from the Harwell
