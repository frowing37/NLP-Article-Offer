An Integral Invariance Principle for Differential Inclusions with Applications in Adaptive Control.
--A
The Byrnes--Martin integral invariance principle for ordinary differential equations is extended to differential inclusions on {Bbb R}N.  The extended result is applied in demonstrating the existence of adaptive stabilizers and servomechanisms for a variety of nonlinear system classes.
